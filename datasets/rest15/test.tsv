Best Indian Restaurant in the City	Indian Restaurant	1
Decor needs to be upgraded but the food is amazing!	Decor	1
This small Astoria souvlaki spot makes what many consider the best gyros in New York.	gyros	1
What really makes it shine is the food, which is aggressively seasoned with Cyrpriot spices, and all made in-house (even the gyro meat and sausages), and made of much higher quality ingredients that might otherwise be expected.	food	1
All the various Greek and Cypriot dishes are excellent, but the gyro is the reason to come--if you don't eat one your trip was wasted.	Greek and Cypriot dishes	1

Maggot in the food!	food	-1
The menu looked great, and the waiter was very nice, but when the food came, it was average.	menu	1
Nevertheless, I finished my plate, and that's when I found a maggot in mushroom sauce at the bottom.	mushroom sauce	-1
I showed it to the manager, and he smilingly apologized and brought us two free desserts (but did not ask us what we wanted and so brought the last two desserts we would have asked for).	manager	1
The manager finally said he would comp the two glasses of wine (which cost less than the food), and made it seem like a big concession.	manager	-1
I have worked in restaurants and cook a lot, and there is no way a maggot should be able to get into well prepared food.	food	-1
For a restaurant with such a good reputation and that is usually so packed, there was no reason for such a lack of intelligent customer service.	restaurant	1

The chicken lollipop is my favorite, most of the dishes (I have to agree with a previous reviewer) are quite oily and very spicy, espeically the Chilli Chicken.	chicken lollipop	1
My mom originally introduced me to this place, but even she (being Indian) feels the food can be somewhat over the top spicy and far too oily.	food	-1
I was speechless by the horrible food.	food	-1
I attended a holiday dinner at the restaurant, and the food was majorly disappointing.	food	-1

I have it a 4 instead of 5 because of the price (just chicken tikka masala - no bread of rice - is $25), which I would expect at a upscale Indian restaurant but this place doesn't have an upscale feel.	chicken tikka masala	1
Also, waiters try to push more food on you, like suggest things as if they are complimentary when they actually cost $.	waiters	-1

However, once I received my predictably mediocre order of what Dokebi thinks passes as Korean fair, (sometimes you have to settle when it's your only option), I got through about half my kimchee before I found a piece of random lettuce accompanied by a far more disgusting, slimy, clearly bad piece of fish skin.	Korean fair	-1
My main concern was the sanity of the food that was being sent out to myself and others, but I would be lying is I said that as someone who has worked in restaurants since the age of fifteen I was expecting at least a minimal effort on the part of the restaurant to amend the situation.	food	-1
My girlfriend, being slightly more aggressive, and having been equally disgusted causing her to throw out the remainder of her barely eaten meal, called back only to be informed that I was probably wrong and that it was most likely an oyster, and that we were also blacklisted from their restaurant.	meal	-1
It wasn't as if this restaurant had any major bragging points before hand, but now it's simply repulsive.	restaurant	-1

If you're planning to come here, make sure that your date is someone whom you really like since you'll be ushered to private booths where there will be no people or food watching (choose the ones on the ground level that have glass ceilings so you may see the stars in the sky!).	private booths	1

Maybe it was the great company (I had friends visiting from Philly – yes, it was not a date this time) or the super reasonable price point, but I just can't say enough good things about this brasserie.	brasserie	1
I don't usually visit the same establishment more than once, what more twice, but I'll come to Zenkichi anytime for a quiet, unhurried and memorable dinner.	Zenkichi	1

If I could give 0 stars I would do so for this place.	place	-1
This place...god where do i begin.	place	-1
It is quite a spectacular scene i'll give them that.	scene	1
The decor however seems to be the distraction so you won't notice that you just payed 300 bucks for some cold eggplant that took 2 FRICKIN HOURS TO COME!!!!	decor	0
How this place survives the competitive west village market in this economy, or any other for that matter, is beyond me.	place	-1
Great Hot Dogs!	Hot Dogs	1
Though it's been crowded most times I've gone here, Bark always delivers on their food.	Bark	1
The hot dogs are top notch, and they're Slamwich is amazing!	hot dogs	1
Going to Bark is always worth the train ride, and will make your tongue and belly very happy!	Bark	1
Only complaint is the pricing--I believe it would be more reasonable to pay a dollar less on each item listed on the menu.	menu	-1
But nonetheless--great spot, great food.	spot	1
Fabulous food - if the front of house staff don't put you off – 	food	1
Each time we've been, the front of house staff (not the waiters - they're fantastic - but the people who greet and seat you) has been so hideous to us that were it not for the exceptional fish dishes I would never return. 	front of house staff	1
As BFC doesn't take reservations you almost always have to wait by the bar - and be abused by the front of house staff until you are seated, which can be over an hour later!	BFC	-1
The frizzy retro girl (with winged/ Dame Edna glasses) will yell at you if you try to order a drink. 	girl	-1
I'd be horrified if my staff were turning away customers so early and so rudely!	staff	-1
"There's another girl who I can't describe, she is about 5'6"" with brown hair, who eavesdrops on your conversation and chimes in - except she only hears the last part of what you said, so her uninvited opinions are often out of context and nothing to do with what you're *really* talking about. "	girl	-1
Considering you will spend at least $60 a head, I expect better service. 	service	-1
"Maitre-D-""Eat and get out"""	Maitre-D	-1
The food and service were fine, however the maitre-D was incredibly unwelcoming and arrogant.	food	1
While finishing our meals which included a high-end bottle of wine, our son's fiance joined us for a glass of wine and dessert.	bottle of wine	1
This guy refused to seat her and she left, followed shortly by the four of us, but not before I told him that in my 40 years of world travel, including Paris, that I had never seen such a display of bad behavior by a frontman in a restaurant.	frontman	-1
"A word to the wise: you can't dine here and disturb the maitre-D's sense of "" table turnover"", as whacked as it is, or else."	maitre-D	-1
Best meal in a long time!	meal	1
Mussles and calamari were superb Saturday evening.	Mussles	1
I had the Lamb special which was perfect.	Lamb special	1
My father had the flank steak which was very good, and my mother had the swordfish.	flank steak	1
The Four Seasons restaurant is a great experience.	The Four Seasons restaurant	1

Taking Hot Dogs to the next level	Hot Dogs	1
At first glance this place seems a bit pricey for a hot dog joint, but at Bark you don't just get your average hot dog.	hot dog	1
Here the hot dog is elevated to the level of a real entree with numerous variations available.	hot dog	1
Great Atmosphere	Atmosphere	1
I highly recommend the fish tacos, everything else was ok.	fish tacos	1
Cool atmosphere, the fire place in the back really ads to it but needs a bit more heat throughout on a cold night.	atmosphere	1
Poor service and management	service	-1
Don't go to this place!	place	-1
Had an awful experience at Casa la Femme on a Saturday dinner.	Casa la Femme	-1
The manager was rude and handled the situation extremely poorly.	manager	-1
Can't believe how an expensive NYC restaurant can be so disrespectful to its clients.	restaurant	-1
The food is very good, but not outstanding.	food	0
There is no way it justifies the accolades it receives, the attitude of the staff or the wait for a table.	staff	-1
Mistakes happen, but they are usually accompanied by an apology, perhaps even a glass of wine...but not the grunt that we received from the Al Di La staff.	staff	-1
The bread was stale, the salad was overpriced and empty.	bread	-1
The pasta was well cooked, didn't have enough sauce though or flavor.	pasta	1
The hostess was rude and I got a distinct feeling that they did not want to serve us.	hostess	-1
The only thing that my friend left out is that when we sat down at the bar the bartender disappeared.	bartender	-1
I asked for a menu and the same waitress looked at my like I was insane.	waitress	-1
"I was shocked that my friends wanted to stay after the waitress said, ""can I help you"" and ""how many are in your party."""	waitress	-1
Shame on this place for the horrible rude staff and non-existent customer service.	staff	-1

I generally like this place.	place	1
The food is good.	food	1
The design of the space is good.	space	1
But the service is HORRID!	service	-1
I was there for brunch recently, and we were tag teamed by a waitress and a waiter.	waitress	-1
The waiter delivered our food while holding what appeared to be a plastic bag of garbage in one hand.	waiter	-1
The waitress came to check in on us every few minutes, and began to clear the plates while half of us were still eating (a big pet peeve of mine that happens almost everywhere, so I try to ignore it).	waitress	-1
I wish I could like this place more, and I wish someone would retrain the staff.	place	-1
