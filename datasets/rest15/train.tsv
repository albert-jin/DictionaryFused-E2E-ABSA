The only thing I moderately enjoyed was their Grilled Chicken special with Edamame Puree.	Grilled Chicken special with Edamame Puree	1
I had never had Edamame pureed before but I thought it was innovative and tasty (could've used a bit more salt).	Edamame pureed	1
The decor is night tho...but they REALLY need to clean that vent in the ceiling...its quite un-appetizing, and kills your effort to make this place look sleek and modern.	decor	1
Their sake list was extensive, but we were looking for Purple Haze, which wasn't listed but made for us upon request!	sake list	1
The spicy tuna roll was unusually good and the rock shrimp tempura was awesome, great appetizer to share!	spicy tuna roll	1

Also, specify if you like your food spicy- its rather bland if you don't.	food	-1
The ambience is pretty and nice for conversation, so a casual lunch here would probably be best.	ambience	1
Add to that great service and great food at a reasonable price and you have yourself the beginning of a great evening.	service	1
The lava cake dessert was incredible and I recommend it.	lava cake dessert	1
Once you step into Cosette, you're miraculously in a small, off-the-beaten path Parisian bistro.	Cosette	1
The food was average to above-average; the French Onion soup filling yet not overly impressive, and the desserts not brilliant in any way.	food	1
However, go for the ambience, and consider the food just a companion for a trip across the world!	ambience	1
The pizza is overpriced and soggy.	pizza	-1
Yes, they use fancy ingredients, but even fancy ingredients don't make for good pizza unless someone knows how to get the crust right.	ingredients	1

There is a downside if you're ordering in -- the delivery guys have MAJOR attitude.	delivery guys	-1
Never have I had such dramatic delivery guys (a lot of huffing and panting and muttering under breath b/c I live in a walkup) who always seem disappointed with their tips.	delivery guys	-1
The pizza was pretty good and huge.	pizza	1
We were 4 and got the family size penne a la vodka which was tremendously gigantic portion...a bucket of food literally.	penne a la vodka	1
The pasta penne was pretty extra buttery, creamy which means a big task to diggest.. tasty at first but i would say that i was full with a slice of pizza and 7 to count, penne...got a little moody afterwards cause was stuffed...lol	pasta penne	-1

I have been coming here for years and have nothing but good things to say about the service and the great staff at La Lanterna.	service	1
Over the years the host, Vittorio, and his crew, have always treated me as family--although with all the business this not-so-little gem does, it amazing he's even able to remember a consistent but not-so-frequent visitor.	host	1
I've also been amazed at all the new additions in the past few years: A new Jazz Bar, the most fantastic Dining Garden, the Best Thin Crust Pizzas, and now a Lasagna Menu which is to die for (these are not your average lasagnas)!	Jazz Bar	1
I lOVE THIS PLACE!	PLACE	1
