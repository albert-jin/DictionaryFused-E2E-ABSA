Nice ambience, but highly overrated place.	ambience	1
Worst Service I Ever Had	Service	1
Everyone that sat in the back outside agreed that it was the worst service we had ever received.	service	-1

I have not a bad thing to say about this place.	place	1
The food was great!	food	1
It's *very* reasonably priced, esp for the quality of the food.	food	1
I had the Kafta plate and it was perfect.	Kafta plate	1
Finally a meal that you will remember for a long time!	meal	1
– In a age of incremental cost cutting in restaurants, its nice to see a place that bucks that trend, and just plain delivers high quality food and good service, period.	food	1
This is the place to relax and enjoy the finest quality food the industry can offer.	place	1
Caution - its real food for people who love the best.	food	1
I liked the atmosphere very much but the food was not worth the price.	atmosphere	1
I may not be a sushi guru but I can tell you that the food here is just okay and that there is not much else to it.	food	-1
Rice is too dry, tuna wasn't so fresh either.	Rice	-1
I have eaten here three times and have found the quality and variety of the fish to be excellent.	fish	1
However, the value and service are both severely lacking.	service	-1
Furthermore, while the fish is unquestionably fresh, rolls tend to be inexplicably bland.	fish	1
The service ranges from mediocre to offensive.	service	-1
On a recent trip, our waiter was extremely dismissive, while no less than three staff members waited hand-and-foot on a pair of Japanese girls seated nearby.	waiter	-1
Freshest sushi  – I love this restaurant.	sushi	1
They pay such detail to everything from miso soup to complex rolls.	miso soup	1
The sashimi was the freshest and most tender I have ever tasted.	sashimi	1
Their apps are all delicious.	apps	1
The only drawback is that this place is really expensive and the portions are on the small side.	place	-1
But the space is small and lovely, and the service is helpful.	space	1
– The food was not great & the waiters were rude.	food	-1
great service	service	1
my service was stellar!	service	1
the bus boy even spotted that my table was shaking a stabilized it for me.	bus boy	1
food was fine, with a some little-tastier-than-normal salsa.	food	1
the food was great, the margaritas too but the waitress was too busy being nice to her other larger party than to take better care of my friend and me.	food	1
Mama Mia – I live in the neighborhood and feel lucky to live by such a great pizza place.	pizza place	1
the only problem is you really have to warm up the pizza before it's edible, even when you order ahead.	pizza	-1
Best Sushi in town.	Sushi	1
The best calamari in Seattle!	calamari	1
– ...and the best summertime deck experience--they will even bring you a blanket if you get cold in the Seattle evening weather.	deck	1
A perfect place to take out of town guests any time of the year.	place	1
Endless fun, awesome music, great staff!!!	music	1
– By far the best bar in the east village...	bar	1
"Every time ""0-sixtynine"" is called the bartender buys everyone drinks!"	bartender	1
Great draft and bottle selection and the pizza rocks.	draft and bottle selection	1
Definitely has one of the best jukebox's i've seen in a long long time.	jukebox's	1
The food is great, the bartenders go that extra mile.	food	1
The owners are great fun and the beer selection is worth staying for.	owners	1
And the upstairs is a great place to hang out.	upstairs	1
Not alot of smoking places left in New York, but I have found my favorite smoking balconey in the city.	balconey	1
The sushi here is delicious!	sushi	1
They have a wide variety of fish and they even list which oceans they come from; Atlantic or Pacific.	fish	1
I've had the Jellyfish, Horse Mackerel, Blue Fin Tuna and the Sake Ikura roll among others, and they were all good.	Jellyfish	1
My only negative comment is that I wish the pieces were a little bigger.	pieces	-1
The decor is rustic, traditional Japanese.	decor	0
The crowd is mixed yuppies, young and old.	crowd	0
The service was courteous and attentive.	service	1
Mediocre food	food	0
The outside patio area has an abbreviated menu.	menu	0
My g/f and I both agreed the food was very mediocre especially considering the price.	food	-1
We are locals, and get the feeling the only way this place survives with such average food is because most customers are probably one-time customer tourists.	place	-1
Service was decent.	Service	0
Drinks were good.	Drinks	1
Unless you are just stopping in for a few drinks I wouldn't recommend going here.	drinks	1
Excellent food, nice ambience, fairly expensive	food	1
– I loved the pumpkin ravioli and the goat cheese gnocchi (5 big ones to a plate instead of 20 or so little gnocchis) and my sister loved her filet mignon on top of spinach and mashed potatoes.	pumpkin ravioli	1
The ambiance was a peaceful and relaxing break amongst all the kids running around in Downtown Disney.	ambiance	1
It was romantic - and even nice even with my sister, reminded me of Italy, and had artwork and music that kept up the feeling of being in a Mediterrean villa.	artwork	1
Best Indian food in L.A.	Indian food	1
The chicken curry and chicken tikka masala are my favorite meat dishes.	chicken curry	1
The chana masala (garbanzo beans) are also excellent.	chana masala (garbanzo beans)	1
It's located in a strip mall near the Beverly Center, not the greatest location, but the food keeps me coming back for more.	location	1
Never too crowded and always great service.	service	1
I think I have probably tried each item on their menu at least once it is all excellent.	menu	1
I can highly recommend their various saag and paneer and korma.	saag	1
I appreciate their delivery too.	delivery	1
Nice food but no spice!	food	1
– I really enjoyed my meal here.	meal	1
I had yummy lamb korma, saag paneer, samosas, naan, etc.	lamb korma	1
The food was all good but it was way too mild.	food	1
I should have thought to bring it up but never expected the food to be that mild.	food	-1
The naan was some of the best I've had and I really enjoyed the bhartha, not too tomatoey.	naan	1
Even the chickpeas, which I normally find too dry, were good.	chickpeas	1
– I don't understand how I was a stranger to this place for so long... the fajita salad, the colorado, the fajitas - EVERYTHING is delicious.	place	1
I love the warm & cosy environment.	environment	1
I just found out that you can have the place to yourself on nights and weekends for a private party - can't wait to celebrate my next birthday there.	place	1

Also have great margaritas!	margaritas	1
Lebanese Food!Yum!	Lebanese Food	1
– I've been to Open Sesame only once, but I'm still reeling from the experience!!	Open Sesame	1
The food is simply unforgettable!	food	1
The presentation of the food was an added bonus, it looked just as great as it tasted!	food	1
My best friend had the chicken shawarma and she STILL raves about it being the best anywhere!	chicken shawarma	1
The staff are friendly and the decor was ethic and colorful.	staff	1
GO TO OPEN SESAME!!!	OPEN SESAME	1
Holy Hummus!	Hummus	1
– The food is here is incredible, though the quality is inconsistent during lunch.	food	1
Dinners have always been excellent, in terms of food quality.	Dinners	1
The open sesame combo plate is a bargain for the heap of food given.	open sesame combo plate	1
The side of potatoes is to die for, as is the labne (yogurt dip).	side of potatoes	1
Also, they serve THE best hummus in America, with a drizzle of fragrant olive oil (which, I believe is the traditional way)!	hummus	1
The only drawback is the crowded seating and the slow service.	seating	-1
However, this place is a gem, and I won't stop going back.	place	1
great beer	beer	1
– My first time to dine at this restaurant was with my son and it was absolutely horrible!	restaurant	-1
I swore never to return for a warm beer and mediocre meal.	beer	-1
The band was very good and the service was attentive.	band	1
We ordered a selection of the small plates, and the shoe string onions, goat cheese pizza, grilled asparagus and fried brie with fruit were all very good.	shoe string onions	1
We have since returned and also had a great experience, sampling more small plates and a variety of the beer ( cold and good).	beer	1
We did have the same waiter the second time, so maybe the service is spotty and our luck is good.	waiter	1
Sunday afternoons there is a band playing and it is lots of fun.	band	1
Seattle's BEST Winelist	Winelist	1
– Ray's (suprisingly) has the city's BEST & most diverse wine list.	wine list	1
The sommelier is fantastic, down-to-earth, & extremely knowlegable.	sommelier	1
I would go back for the wine experience alone.	wine	1
NOT THE PLACE IT ONCE WAS	PLACE	-1
"– It is sad to see a place that was once ""THE"" place to meet and eat for Bfast or Lunch, now be the place that is a big ""DONT BOTHER."""	place	-1
The food is not what it once was (potions have seriously seen downsizing) prices have gone up, and the service is the worst I have experienced anywhere (including mainland Europe).	food	-1
What may be interesting to most is the worst sevice/attitude comes from the owners of this establishment.	owners	-1
"This establishment really made a marked decline after ( and this is recurring story ) the airing of FOOD TELEVISIONS ""DINERS, DRIVE-INS, AND DIVES"" hosted by Guy Fieri, in which Schooner or Later was subject of."	establishment	-1
"Perhaps now, Scooner or Later falls into the ""Dive"" category."	Scooner or Later	-1
I hope one day Scooner or Later returns to what it once was.	Scooner or Later	-1

The best place for a leisure Sunday breakfast amidst yachts, then take a stroll through the nearby Farmer's Market.	place	1
great meal – the fish on the omikase platter was absolutely decadent -- there was none of the stringiness that sometimes accompanies fair sushi -- this fish was perfect!!!!	meal	1

Save room for  scrumptious desserts.	desserts	1
The restaurant offers an extensive wine list and an ambiance you won't forget!	wine list	1
– Best Mexican place for lunch in the financial district.	Mexican place	1
Love the enchiladas and chicken soup - and be sure to check out their specials.	enchiladas	1
The cooks have been at the restaurant for years and cook family recipes.	cooks	1
Can get busy on Fridays for a table but once seated, the service is so efficient you can be in and out of there quickly.	service	1
The sushi was excellent and the wait staff was quick.	sushi	1
The atmosphere was just okay.	atmosphere	0
Space was limited, but the food made up for it.	Space	1

Not only can the selection be innovative, but there's a nice balance of traditional sushi as well.	selection	1
The nicest waiters in town.	waiters	1
– This place is unbelievably over-rated.	place	-1
If I want to stand in line on Sunday for an hour to get average brunch food, then I would put Murphy's at the top of the list.	brunch food	0
The regular menu here is slightly above average that is not worth the snotty attitude that you receive.	regular menu	0

Poor customer service/poor pizza.	customer service pizza	-1
– As with most restaurants in Seattle, Mioposto's service was bad and the food was overpriced.	service	-1
I know many people have their favorite types of pizza and pizza places, but Mioposto's pizza lacks quality and good taste.	pizza	-1
To be honest, I've had better frozen pizza.	pizza	-1
The only positive thing about Mioposto is the nice location.	Mioposto	1
I was frankly shocked when I read the bad reviews - this place is fantastic; it has not let us down in any way, and we've eaten here more than 10 times.	place	1
The food is fantastic, and the waiting staff has been perfect every single time we've been there.	food	1
The only problem would be the wait, but we usually just have a drink in the front while waiting.	wait	0

The food was ok, but the service was so poor that the food was cold buy the time everyone in my party was served.	food	0
We had a very hard time getting the waitress' attention and finally had to get up and go inside to speak to a manager.	waitress	-1
As it turns out the owner was seated right next to us and when he came over to check on our problems was very dismissive and offered a token 20% discount on our bill.	owner	-1
AVOID THE PLACE	PLACE	-1
When I got there I sat up stairs where the atmosphere was cozy & the service was horrible!	atmosphere	1
I waited for 10-15 minutes for service ordered a beer & was never served again.	service	-1
I went home & looked them up online again where I discovered there is a link for a give away that doesn't work so emailed the restaurant about the non existent service & deceptive link.	restaurant	-1
After sitting at the bar for over 20 minutes the bar keep had made only 2 drinks & kept telling us she'd be right with us.	bar keep	-1

Best Crab Cakes in Town	Crab Cakes	1

If you can, come to this place by boat and make it a whole evening.	place	1
Great seasonal fish and seafood, with a classy waterfront setting.	seasonal fish	1
Great Pizza, Poor Service	Pizza	1
– Love their pizza, especially the mushroom pizza.	pizza	1
Also love their caeser salad.	caeser salad	1
Prefer to order it and pick it up though because I don't like the servers, one young woman in particular.	servers	-1
Management should really take notice and train their waitstaff and teach them some proper manners.	Management	-1
Many people talk about the great pizza and poor service, so it can't just be the rantings of a few dissatisfied customers.	pizza	1
It's a great little place with tons of potential to be a neighborhood joint if the service weren't so impersonal and corporate-like.	place	1
Great Breakfast	Breakfast	1
– This place is famous for their breakfast.	breakfast	1
The food is great and they make a mean bloody mary.	food	1

for desert we had the mango ginger creme brulee... oh la la yummy!!!	mango ginger creme brulee	1
we are for sure coming back to this restaurant.	restaurant	1
Chintzy portions	portions	-1
– The sushi here is perfectly good, but for $5 a piece, either the slices of fish should be larger, or there should be no pretense that this is a moderately priced restaurant (even for NYC).	sushi	1
I'm astonished that this restaurant is categorized as $$$ rather than $$$$.	restaurant	-1
Terrible service, food ok, pricey	service	0
In other words, if they aren't making $$ off of you then you don't rate high on their 'service scale'.	service	-1
Food wise, its ok but a bit pricey for what you get considering the restaurant isn't a fancy place.	Food	0
If I needed to name some they would include the location to the beach or Golden Gate park.	location	1
Another plus is the open feel of the restaurant with glass walls on all sides.	feel	1
Amazing Spanish Mackeral special appetizer and perfect box sushi (that eel with avodcao -- um um um).	Spanish Mackeral special appetizer	1
As usual the omikase didn't disappoint in freshness, although it scored low on creativity and selection.	omikase	1

Very poor customer service.	customer service	-1
– Schooner or Later's charming location along the marina in Long Beach and average food does not, unfortunately, compensate for its very poor customer service.	location along the marina in Long Beach	1
While this diner had reasonably good food, the restaurant staff seemed completely indifferent to our presence, and this attitude was reflected in the lack of service.	food	1
After one member of our party had been bumped repeatedly by a waitress, a polite request that he not be bumped sent the waitress into an abusive rant.	waitress	-1
"A brief conversation with the manager at the end of the meal was the greatest disappointment--to say we had been ""blown off"" would be an understatement."	manager	-1
"The manager continually interrupted with ""Is there anything else I can do for you?"", a strange comment because she had hardly listened, let alone responded to our expression of disappointment at our experience."	manager	-1
you are with a hot date and he/she has an urge for sushi...then this might be the place.	sushi	1

The steak was done to my exact liking (medium rare) and was nice and juicy.	steak	1
It?s served with either a peppercorn sauce or red wine reduction, though both were indistinguishable in taste.	peppercorn sauce	0
Though, one thing I realized later on was that the restaurant either used MSG or a meat tenderizer on the steak.	steak	-1
The desert was the perfect ending to an almost perfect dinner.	desert	1
But the servers were extremely attentive and very friendly.	servers	1
Overall, I would go back and eat at the restaurant again.	restaurant	1

The waiter was a bit unfriendly and the feel of the restaurant was crowded.	waiter	-1
Also, there was only one bathroom stall- probably need more for such big crowds.	bathroom stall	-1
Most importantly, we were so excited about the food after seeing the very creative menu.	menu	1
At best, the food was good and definately overpriced.	food	0

To the owners of Open Sesame...Bravo...I can't wait to come back to dine at your restaurant!	Open Sesame	1
It's a tiny place so if you get there before 8pm on a weekend (Thurs?Sun) you will find it easier to get a table or a seat at the sushi bar.	place	0
Everything, and I mean everything on the menu is delectable.	menu	1
The waiters are very experienced and helpful with pairing your drink choice to your food tastes or vice versa.	waiters	1
The sushi is as fresh as it comes?you'd think ocean was in their backyard, no joke!	sushi	1
If you're interested in good tasting (without the fish taste or smell), large portions and creative sushi dishes this is your place...	portions	1

The appetizer was interesting, but the Creme Brulee was very savory and delicious.	appetizer	1
Indoor ambience was modern.	Indoor ambience	1
If it's nice outside, request for a table in the balcony.	balcony	1
It's a great place to people watch.	place	1

Late night dinning with exeptional food.	food	1
We were seated right away, the table was private and nice.	table	1
The service was exceptional - sometime there was a feeling that we were served by the army of friendly waiters.	service	1
The food was very good, filet mignon was probably the best I've ever try.	food	1
The portions are big though, so do not order too much.	portions	0
Groovy music made the dinner casual.	music	1
I have a but here - there was a bathroom attendant in the restroom which was odd.	restroom	-1
The bathroom itself is very small with two toilets and only one sink, the girl was staying totally on the way hanging out paper towels from the dispenser.	bathroom	-1
This place rocks!!	place	1

The presentation of Snooze is excellent and it is one of those places that you feel more sophisticated just for being there; but peel back the layers and you have an overpriced IHOP with a high brow menu.	Snooze	1
To start off, approximately 8-10 oz of orange juice will cost you $3.	orange juice	-1
They serve it in a tall, skinny hour-glass shaped glass to disguise the fact that you a getting a small juice at the price of a half gallon in a supermarket.	juice	-1
I should have just asked for the check when I saw that; but their menu was so unique that I continued.	menu	1
"The pancakes were certainly inventive but $8.50 for 3 - 6"" pancakes (one of them was more like 5"") in the pancake flight (sample of 3 different pancakes) is well over-priced."	pancakes	1
"The pancakes should be larger (at least 8"") to justify the expense even with the unique offerings."	pancakes	-1
On my meal I had to send back my eggs for a simple request of breaking the yokes before cooking, and would have had to send them back again if I hadn't rejected the meal all together.	meal	-1
I rejected it because in the process of attempting to fix the eggs they broke something else in the dish and I was too frustrated to continue.	dish	-1
To their credit they removed the dish from the check; but no manager stopped by to ask what the problem was.	manager	-1
In the end our check came to $27 for 4 small pancakes, a breakfast burrito, an orange juice and an iced tea (I had water).	pancakes	-1
Much more than just a great view!	view	1
– I am exceedingly pleased to report that my dinner at Ray's Boathouse last Friday completely exceeded my expectations.	Ray's Boathouse	1
Ray's is something of a Seattle institution, but given its gorgeous Sound views, I had suspected that the accolades were more due to the scenery than to the food and service.	Sound views	1
Imagine my happy surprise upon finding that the views are only the third-best thing about Ray's!	views	1
To start things off, our lovely server Brooke was quickly on hand to take my drink order.	Brooke	1
My party of two was feeling particularly ambitious, and we splurged on the Shilshole Sampler...a beautiful assortment of enormous white gulf prawns, smoked albacore tuna, Ray's fantastic manila clams seasoned with dill, scallops in a tasty soy dressing, and a tiny pile of Dungeness crab atop a sublime butter sauce.	Shilshole Sampler	1
For my entr&eacute;e, I completely enjoyed the seared Alaskan sea scallops complemented by chard, artichoke hearts, fennel, and pecorino toscano.	seared Alaskan sea scallops	1
The scallops are apparently cooked in a black olive butter which really makes them unique (not to mention tasty).	scallops	1
My friend enjoyed the grilled Alaskan King Salmon with delectable creamed Washington russet potatoes and crisp green beans.	grilled Alaskan King Salmon	1
I had a taste of all three items on her plate, and they were superb.	plate	1
Our server continued to be attentive throughout the night, but I did remain puzzled by one issue:  Who thinks that Ray's is an appropriate place to take young children for dinner?	server	1
All considered, I have to say that Ray's Boathouse is deserving of its title as a Seattle institution.	Ray's Boathouse	1
While I could have done without the youth who shared the evening with us, our wonderful server and food made the experience a very positive one.	server	1
Oh yeah...the view was good, too.	view	1
