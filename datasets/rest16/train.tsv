The decor is night tho...but they REALLY need to clean that vent in the ceiling...its quite un-appetizing, and kills your effort to make this place look sleek and modern.	decor	1

Fabulous decor - makes you feel like you're in a trendy Manhattan restaurant, very very good food, cheaply-priced, generally friendly staff, and if you're a Manhattanite, or spend most of your time in Manhattan, Rice Avenue will make you feel at home.....very Soho/Village/Upper West Side minus the expensive prices and pretentious clientele.....all on Roosevelt Avenue!	decor	1

At this point, the waitress comes over and asks us if everything was okay, I was literally so shocked that I was speechless and didn't say anything, and guess what, the waitress WALKED away.	waitress	-1
So, I switch with my boyfriend again to see if maybe I could stomach the meat and spinach again, but the spinach was so undercooked that I just could not bite through it.	spinach	-1
This is where it really really gets bad: the manager said, there is absolutely nothing we can do, it's a matter of taste that she didn't like it, and I cannot comp it.	manager	-1
The manager came to the table and said we can do what we want, so we paid for what we did enjoy, the drinks and appetizers, and walked out.	manager	1

Single Worst Restaurant in Manhattan	Restaurant	-1
I'll being with a couple of positives: cool decor, good pita and hummus, and grilled octopus that was actually pretty tasty.	decor	1
If I could give 0 stars I would do so for this place.	place	-1
This place...god where do i begin.	place	-1
It is quite a spectacular scene i'll give them that.	scene	1
The decor however seems to be the distraction so you won't notice that you just payed 300 bucks for some cold eggplant that took 2 FRICKIN HOURS TO COME!!!!	decor	0
How this place survives the competitive west village market in this economy, or any other for that matter, is beyond me.	place	-1
Great Hot Dogs!	Hot Dogs	1
The hot dogs are top notch, and they're Slamwich is amazing!	hot dogs	1
Going to Bark is always worth the train ride, and will make your tongue and belly very happy!	Bark	1
Only complaint is the pricing--I believe it would be more reasonable to pay a dollar less on each item listed on the menu.	menu	-1
But nonetheless--great spot, great food.	spot	1
Fabulous food - if the front of house staff don't put you off – 	food	1
Each time we've been, the front of house staff (not the waiters - they're fantastic - but the people who greet and seat you) has been so hideous to us that were it not for the exceptional fish dishes I would never return. 	front of house staff	1
As BFC doesn't take reservations you almost always have to wait by the bar - and be abused by the front of house staff until you are seated, which can be over an hour later!	BFC	-1
The frizzy retro girl (with winged/ Dame Edna glasses) will yell at you if you try to order a drink. 	girl	-1
I'd be horrified if my staff were turning away customers so early and so rudely!	staff	-1
"There's another girl who I can't describe, she is about 5'6"" with brown hair, who eavesdrops on your conversation and chimes in - except she only hears the last part of what you said, so her uninvited opinions are often out of context and nothing to do with what you're *really* talking about. "	girl	-1
Considering you will spend at least $60 a head, I expect better service. 	service	-1

The food and service were fine, however the maitre-D was incredibly unwelcoming and arrogant.	food	1
While finishing our meals which included a high-end bottle of wine, our son's fiance joined us for a glass of wine and dessert.	bottle of wine	1
This guy refused to seat her and she left, followed shortly by the four of us, but not before I told him that in my 40 years of world travel, including Paris, that I had never seen such a display of bad behavior by a frontman in a restaurant.	frontman	-1
"A word to the wise: you can't dine here and disturb the maitre-D's sense of "" table turnover"", as whacked as it is, or else."	maitre-D	-1

Taking Hot Dogs to the next level	Hot Dogs	1
At first glance this place seems a bit pricey for a hot dog joint, but at Bark you don't just get your average hot dog.	hot dog	1
Great Atmosphere	Atmosphere	1
I highly recommend the fish tacos, everything else was ok.	fish tacos	1
Cool atmosphere, the fire place in the back really ads to it but needs a bit more heat throughout on a cold night.	atmosphere	1
Poor service and management	service	-1
Don't go to this place!	place	-1
Had an awful experience at Casa la Femme on a Saturday dinner.	Casa la Femme	-1

Can't believe how an expensive NYC restaurant can be so disrespectful to its clients.	restaurant	-1
The food is very good, but not outstanding.	food	0
There is no way it justifies the accolades it receives, the attitude of the staff or the wait for a table.	staff	-1
Mistakes happen, but they are usually accompanied by an apology, perhaps even a glass of wine...but not the grunt that we received from the Al Di La staff.	staff	-1
The bread was stale, the salad was overpriced and empty.	bread	-1
The pasta was well cooked, didn't have enough sauce though or flavor.	pasta	1
The hostess was rude and I got a distinct feeling that they did not want to serve us.	hostess	-1
The only thing that my friend left out is that when we sat down at the bar the bartender disappeared.	bartender	-1

I was there for brunch recently, and we were tag teamed by a waitress and a waiter.	waitress	-1
The waiter delivered our food while holding what appeared to be a plastic bag of garbage in one hand.	waiter	-1
The waitress came to check in on us every few minutes, and began to clear the plates while half of us were still eating (a big pet peeve of mine that happens almost everywhere, so I try to ignore it).	waitress	-1
I wish I could like this place more, and I wish someone would retrain the staff.	place	-1
